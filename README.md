# Code (Learning Journey)

This repository is my personal learning space while I follow an education pathway and build small projects.

## What you’ll find here

- **Lessons/**  
  Notes, reflections, and short write-ups from what I learn day by day.

- **Projects/**  
  Small projects I build to practice real programming skills (coding, debugging, organizing code, using Git).

## Current focus

- Learning Python step by step (clean code, functions, loops, input handling)
- Using **Git/GitHub** properly (commits, .gitignore, pushing clean projects)
- Building projects that use **persistent storage** (SQLite)

## Featured project: GuessTheWord

A “guess the word” game that stores word difficulty in a SQLite database and updates it based on user success/failure over time.
